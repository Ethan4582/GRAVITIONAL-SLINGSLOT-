Gravitational Slingshot Effect

This Python program is designed to provide a visual simulation of a gravitational slingshot effect. It allows users to observe how spacecraft interact with a massive planet's gravitational field, creating a captivating and educational experience.

The simulation represents the behavior of objects in a gravitational field, particularly spacecraft near a planet. The program allows users to interact with the simulation by launching spacecraft from a specific point on the screen. These spacecraft are affected by the planet's gravitational force, and their paths are determined by their initial velocity vectors. Users can create multiple spacecraft, launch them, and observe how they move in response to the planet's gravity.

The primary goal of this program is to offer an engaging and hands-on way for users to learn about gravitational physics concepts, such as how objects are attracted to massive bodies and how the launch velocity affects their trajectories. It provides an interactive environment where users can experiment with launching spacecraft at different angles and velocities to see the resulting paths.

Experiment and Learn: Feel free to experiment with launching multiple spacecraft, changing their paths, and observing their movements. The program provides a visual representation of gravitational interactions that can help users understand fundamental physics principles.
